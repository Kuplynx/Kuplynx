- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kuplynx
- 13
- Computer & Crypto Enthusiast 
- Languages I use:
  - Python
  - TypeScript/JS
  - C/C++
- Languages I may use in the future:
  - V
  - Rust
  - Go
- Currently working on my portfolio, but other projects may come up such as a real implementation of ottomated/reqlang.
- Will also develop a ton of libraries for personal use, maybe initially written in V and bindings?
